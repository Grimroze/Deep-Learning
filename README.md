🚀 Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains my hands-on deep learning projects, experiments, and learning implementations. Each project focuses on understanding core concepts such as neural networks, convolutional architectures, transfer learning, data preprocessing, model training, and real-world prediction workflows.

The goal of this repo is to document my progress as I learn deep learning—from fundamental models to advanced architectures—while building practical, end-to-end applications in Python using TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential libraries.

Projects include tasks like image classification, sentiment analysis, and other model-driven workflows, with each folder containing:

Clean and reproducible code

Preprocessing steps

Model architecture and training logs

Evaluation results

A simple prediction or inference pipeline

This repository will continue to grow as I explore more domains in deep learning and experiment with different architectures and techniques.
